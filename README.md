This is a school project for the course "HTML, CSS, Javascript & Webbstandarder" offered by Lernia in Sweden.

The website has been created by me including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. Additionally, I have used jQuery to manipulate DOM and to manipulate CSS. I have also used Bootstrap as a design tool. 

Who am I? I am Artina Ferizi, a student at Lernia, and can be contacted on LinkedIn: https://se.linkedin.com/in/artina-ferizi
